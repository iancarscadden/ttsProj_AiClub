STEPS FOR EXPANDING:

1) Figure out how to run the code from colab in a local ide.
  a) https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2 
  * we can use this github repo and try to use the steps provided to put the model into our local ide
  * from there we can use chris's audio files to possibly retrain the model 
  * might need to find a way to implement the synthesizer
2) Version Control
3) Audio to text conversion
4) text to gpt 
5) gpt to chris voice

Optional:
1) Run on server somehow so it is accessible from the cloud
2) Make some form of interface
3)
